# Language-Processing

The work in this repository aims to recreate the important
ideas in natural language processing from scratch. My goal here
is to learn both the fundamental ideas in the field and well 
improve my skills in Rust ðŸ¦€ and data engineering!

I am currently working on implementing n-gram based 
language models.

At present the directory structure is:
	
* `ngram/` holds the n-gram language model.
* `data/` holds tools to clean and process data (copora of text).
* `data/raw/` used to hold raw downloaded data. Not tracked by git.
* `data/formated/` used to hold formated data. Not tracked by git.
